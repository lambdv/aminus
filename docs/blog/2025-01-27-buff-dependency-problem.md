# Buff Dependency Problem

When calculating teamdps in genshin impact, characters are often buffed by other characters. this may be full uptime or only for certain attacks in a rotation.
Trying to model this in a dps calculator can be challenging, as we then need consider the order of building/computing stat tables and dependencies between stat tables in order to accurately compute damage.

## Assumptions

Let's consider a Raiden team composition with the following rotation:

```
Raiden E > Kazuha E > Sara E > Bennett Q > Kazuha Q > Sara Q > Raiden Q combo > Bennett E

let bennettBuff(self) => self.baseATK*132%
let kazuhaBuff(self) => self.EM*0.04%
let saraBuff(self) => self.baseATK*73.03%
```

## Problem Statement

When modeling stats and rotation operations for a Raiden team DPS calculation, we face two critical questions:

1. **What is the order of building/computing static stat tables for each character?**
2. **What is the order of computing damage based on dynamic buffs?**

### Issue

Stat tables should be built statically as a base before any damage calculation is done. However, stat tables for certain attacks may be "buffed" by other stat tables (with a given state), thus having to be computed dynamically/on the fly for that attack.

Here's where the complexity arises:

- **Raiden E** may be built statically
- **Raiden Q** dynamically depends on Bennett, Sara, and Kazuha being fully built to compute buffs accurately
- This requires Sara, Kazuha, and Bennett to be fully built first
- However, **Kazuha Q** depends on Sara and Bennett to be built to calculate his damage accurately
- But **Sara Q** and **Bennett Q** also depend on Kazuha being built to calculate their damage accurately

This creates an **acyclic graph** that may lead to either:
- Inaccurate buff evaluation leading to inaccurate results
- A deadlock/infinite recursion state

## Challenge

The buff dependency problem represents a fundamental challenge in game theory and optimization algorithms. It's not just about calculating damage numbersâ€”it's about determining the correct order of operations when each operation depends on the results of others.

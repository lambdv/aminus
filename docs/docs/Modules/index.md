# Modules

This section contains documentation for all the major modules in the aminus library.

## Core Modules

- [Model](./model/index.md) - Core data structures for modeling in-game entities and attributes
- [Functions](./functions/index.md) - Mathematical functions, formulas, and optimization algorithms
- [Data](./data/index.md) - Data adapters and external data integration
- [Energy](./energy/index.md) - Energy system calculations and specifications
- [Utils](./utils/index.md) - Utility functions and helper modules

## Module Overview

The aminus library is organized into several core modules:

- **Model**: Contains the fundamental data structures that represent game entities like characters, artifacts, weapons, and their associated statistics.

- **Functions**: Provides mathematical functions for damage calculations, optimization algorithms, and various formulas used in the game mechanics.

- **Data**: Handles external data integration, particularly for game data from sources like Irminsul.

- **Energy**: Manages energy system calculations and related specifications for character abilities and rotations.

- **Utils**: Contains utility functions and helper modules that support the other modules.

Each module is designed to be modular and focused on a specific aspect of the game mechanics, making the codebase maintainable and extensible.

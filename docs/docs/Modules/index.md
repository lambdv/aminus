# Modules
aminus library is organized into several modules:

- **Model**: Contains the fundamental data structures that represent game entities like characters, artifacts, weapons, and their associated statistics.

- **Functions**: Provides mathematical functions for damage calculations, optimization algorithms, and various formulas used in the game mechanics.

- **Data**: Handles external data integration, particularly for game data from sources like Irminsul.

- **Energy**: Manages energy system calculations and related specifications for character abilities and rotations.

- **Utils**: Contains utility functions and helper modules that support the other modules.
